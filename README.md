# Credit Memo Generator using LLM

Automatically generate credit memos from structured and unstructured customer data using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

This project demonstrates how LLMs can streamline the credit analysis process by generating clear, standardized memos based on customer data. It supports:

- üîÅ Locally hosted models (via Ollama: Mistral, LLaMA)


The app is built using **Streamlit** and provides a simple interface.

## Problem Statement

## Business Impact

- ‚è±Ô∏è Reduces time spent on memo writing
- üìÑ Standardizes documentation quality
- ‚ö° Enables faster and explainable credit decisions

## Tech Stack

- **LLMs**: Mistral / LLaMA (via Ollama)
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit, LangChain, LlamaIndex
- **Data**: Mock structured data (JSON/YAML)
- **Environment**: Python 3.9+, `requirements.txt` included
